To use the XML application modules (as used by the subscribe example script),
you will need newer versions of libxml2 and libxslt than are provided by OS-X.
Currently, the easiest way to install these is through fink.

- Install fink from:
    http://www.finkproject.org/download

- Install libxml2 and libxslt (you may need to open a new console for the new
  PATH settings to take effect):
    sudo fink install libxml2 libxslt

- Install the lxml Python module (again, a fresh console may be needed):
    easy_install lxml

To use MSRP in the invite example script, you will need msrprelay installed:

- Download msrprelay from http://msrprelay.org and do:
    sudo python setup.py install
