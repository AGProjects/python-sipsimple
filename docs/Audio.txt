Audio Device Sharing on Linux
-----------------------------

Some audio devices support hardware mixing, these device can be opened
multiple times from different application natively. If this is not the case,
you will notice that is not possible to use SIP SIMPLE client SDK and play
music or use other audio applications at the same time with the default
system configuration.

For audio devices that can be opened only once, there are workarounds. More
information about them can be found in section 'The card does not support
hardware mixing', at:

http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php/AlsaSharing

One of these workarounds is to create or modify /etc/asound.conf, for all
uses in the system or ~/.asoundrc, valid only for the user that runs
python-simsiple as follows:

pcm.card0 {
  type hw
  card 0
}
pcm.dmix0 {
  type dmix
  ipc_key 34521
  slave {
    pcm "card0"
    rate 16000
    period_size 320
    buffer_size 10240
  }
}
pcm.dsnoop0 {
  type dsnoop
  ipc_key 34521
  slave {
    pcm "card0"
    rate 16000
    period_size 320
    buffer_size 10240
  }
}
pcm.asym0 {
  type asym
  playback.pcm "dmix0"
  capture.pcm "dsnoop0"
}
pcm.pasym0 {
  type plug
  slave.pcm "asym0"
}
pcm.dsp0 {
  type plug
  slave.pcm "asym0"
}
ctl.dsp0 {
  type hw
  card 0
}
pcm.!default {
  type plug
  slave.pcm "asym0"
}
ctl.!default {
  type hw
  card 0
}


What the above configuration does, is to create a special device called
asym0 (you may rename this as you wish) of type asym. asym is an ALSA plugin
that combines plugins like dsnoop and dmix into one full-duplex device. The
dsnoop and dmix plugins allows for concurrent access from multiple
applications to the same physical audio device for input and output
respectively mixing and converting the sample rates accordingly.

Then instruct SIP SIMPLE client SDK to use asym0 as the main device:

sip-settings -g set audio.input_device=asym0
sip-settings -g set audio.output_device=asym0
sip-settings -g set audio.alert_device=asym0

Note. It is important that other applications in the system also access the
same virtual device, otherwise is still possible to block the access to the
audio card by opening it first from an application that does not use asym0
as default device.
