Install dependencies
--------------------

The software works on MacOSx 10.5 or newer on Intel CPUs only. You must have
installed the Apple Developer tools before proceeding to the next steps.

Install fink from http://www.finkproject.org/download

Install libxml2 and libxslt (you may need to open a new console for the new
PATH settings to take effect):

sudo fink install libxml2 libxslt
sudo easy_install lxml
sudo easy_install cython
sudo easy_install python-application
sudo easy_install dnspython

An alternative method to install the above python packages is to download,
unpack and run (as root):

sudo python setup.py build; sudo python setup.py install

for each of them in the directories where they were unpacked.

Install the python-xcaplib library from:
http://download.ag-projects.com/OpenXCAP/clients/


Compile PJSIP library
---------------------

Check out PJSIP from SVN in the pypjua main directory:

svn co http://svn.pjsip.org/repos/pjproject/trunk pjsip

Compile pjsip C library (after changing the UDP message limit to 64K):

cd pjsip
grep  PJSIP_MAX_PKT_LEN pjlib/include/pj/config_site.h >/dev/null || echo '#define PJSIP_MAX_PKT_LEN 65536' >>pjlib/include/pj/config_site.h
make distclean
CFLAGS="-arch i386" ./configure
make


Building pypjua library
-----------------------

Go to the main pypjua directory and build the library:

cd..
./build_inplace

which generates:

pypjua/_pjsip.c    
pypjua/_pjsip.so

The _pjsip.so library can then be imported in the target software. 


Installing the library
----------------------

To install system-wide the library and the sample scripts run:

sudo python setup.py install


Testing the library
-------------------

See README.txt in the scripts directory directory.
