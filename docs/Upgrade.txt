From 0.3.0 to 0.4.0
-------------------

Before upgrading to 0.4.0:

a. Make sure you have up to date versions of eventlet, python-msrplib and
   python-xcaplib libraries
b. Remove all files and folders named sipclient* or sipsimple* located under
   your site-packages Python folder

After pulling the patch "Added PJSIP patch that adds "i=" line" (Jan 20, 2009):

  If sipsimple was compiled before this patch was pulled, please perform the
  following command instead of "sudo python setup.py install" to have PJSIP
  compiled from scratch:
    sudo python setup.py build_ext --pjsip-clean-compile install
