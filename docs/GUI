GUI design
----------

The initial setup dialog must be presented to the user like this:

+--------------------------------+
|                                | 
| SIP address: alice@example.com |
| Password   : _________________ |
|                                |
| x Auto-create a SIP address    |
|                                |
|        < Sign in >             |
|                                |
+--------------------------------+

alice@example.com is a help text, displayed in grey, so that the user has a
clue of what to enter there. Once it clicks in that field, the help text
dissapears. When ticking Auto-create option, a field element with E-mail
address appears to let the user enter his email address used for enrollment.

The SIP UA should be able to work on the LAN without configuration (aka
Bonjour that allows auto-discovery of all other sip clients on the network).

Never display words the user cannot understand. Better display large
rectangular easy to understand icons instead of words (like iPhone).

Never display choices the user cannot understand. Eliminate choices as much
as possible.

More than one click to execute an action must be avoided.

User can dial telephone numbers, partial (without the domain part) and
complete SIP addresses in a simple text field. 

Previosly dialed SIP addresses must be stored and auto-completed.

The GUI must be focused on Instant Messaging (IM) with the display for rich
presence that contain icons and text. 

Display only relevant presence information (device status, note,
geo-location and mood).

The buddy list may contain the picture of each buddy, the picture can be
updated by each buddy.

The IM chat interface may display the the icon/picture of the buddy to
avoid typing messages to the wrong person.

When using multiple SIP accounts, the SIP account used for an outboud
session should be easy to select and the current SIP identity should be
clearly displayed.

Video is a must have useless feature.

Desktop sharing is a usefull feature for home environment (help familly
members solve their computer problems, do online shopping or plan holidays
together). It is important to have a little window displaying what the
remote party is seeing.

The option order when starting a new session is: IM, Audio, Video, File
transfer, Desktop sharing.

The user must not be anoyed by notifications generated by the GUI. If
buddies come online/offline do not disturb the user.

When a new session setup request arrives, do not provide an alert window
with a choice already focused, the user might be in the middle of typing
something in a different window and a focused button can cause an unwanted
action.

Ability to conference multiple persons in the SIP UA is required.

Logging of all network interactions must be available for savy users.

Multi-party conferencing (invite people to a chat room) is a must to be able
to replace Jabber/XMPP.

The default IM type is session based (using MSRP), if the remote party does
not support MSRP media, automatically fall back to SIP MESSAGE method.
