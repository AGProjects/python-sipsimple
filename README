Description
-----------

SIP SIMPLE client SDK is a Software Development Kit for development of Real
Time Applications based on SIP and related protocols for Audio, Instant
Messaging, File Transfers, Desktop Sharing and Presence. Other media types
can be easily added by using an extensible high-level API.

The software has undergone in the past years several interoperability tests
at SIPIT (http://www.sipit.net) and today is of industry strength quality.

The SIP stack is provided by PJSIP (http://www.pjsip.org)


Background
----------

SIP stands for 'Sessions Initiation Protocol', an IETF standard described by
RFC3261. SIP is an application-layer control protocol that can establish,
modify and terminate multimedia sessions such as Internet telephony calls
(VoIP). Media can be added to (and removed from) an existing session.

SIP allows the endpoints to negotiate and combine any type of session they
mutually understand like video, instant messaging (IM), file transfer,
desktop sharing and provides a generic event notification system with
real-time publications and subscriptions about state changes that can be
used for asynchronous services like presence, message waiting indicator and
busy line appearance.


Features
--------

The library has cross platform capabilities on Linux OS, Mac OSX (Leopard
and Snow Leopard) and Microsoft Windows.  The library should work with
minimal changes on any platform that supports C and Python development
environments.

 * Configuration framework
 * TLS Security for signaling (SIP) and media (MSRP, XCAP)
 * Multiple SIP Accounts support
 * Multiple Media Types per Session (e.g. Audio + IM)
 * Trace capability for all underlying protocols
 * Failover for DNS lookups, SIP and MSRP routing
 * Supports re-INVITE for adding and removing media
 * Automatically handling if IP Address changes
 * Audio conference bridge
