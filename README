Description
-----------

Python Sip Client is software library built on top of PJSIP that together
with an elegant middleware allows for easy development of real-time
communications Internet end-points based on SIP protocol with rich Presence,
Interactive Messaging (IM) and File Transfer capabilities.

The goal of this project is to deliver the best Open Source development kit
for rich featured SIP User Agents, while hiding the complex underlying
functionality behind an easy to use high-level application programming
interface. Compared to other available SIP libraries, this project provides
session based Interactive Messaging (IM) using MSRP protocol, multiple
streams support and 'the missing' SIP-SIMPLE features for rich presence:
presence rules, resource lists, RLS services, rich PIDF and XCAP policy.

The software library is tested against the most popular SIP server software
available today: OpenSER, Asterisk, OpenXCAP, MSRPRelay and MediaProxy.

Several command line tools are available for setting up real time voice, IM
and file transfer sessions, publish and subscribe to presence or other type
of events:

- sip_register
- sip_rtp_audio_session
- sip_msrp_im_session
- sip_msrp_file_transfer
- sip_publish_presence
- sip_subscribe_presence
- sip_subscribe_winfo
- sip_subscribe_rls
- sip_message
- xcap_rls_services
- xcap_pres_rules
- xcap_pidf_manipulation

Some scripts can be used to setup audio (VoIP), interactive messaging (IM)
and file transfer sessions. Other scripts can be used to publish presence
information and subscribe to presence or other type of events. Running each
script with --help argument displays the script capabilities and the
required arguments.


Overview of SIP and Presence functionality
------------------------------------------

From RFC 3261: "SIP is an application-layer control protocol that can
establish, modify, and terminate multimedia sessions (conferences) such as
Internet telephony calls.  SIP can also invite participants to already
existing sessions, such as multicast conferences.  Media can be added to
(and removed from) an existing session.  SIP transparently supports name
mapping and redirection services, which supports personal mobility, users
can maintain a single externally visible identifier regardless of their
network location.

SIP supports five facets of establishing and terminating multimedia
communications:

 - User location: determination of the end system to be used for
   communication;

 - User availability: determination of the willingness of the called party
   to engage in communications;

 - User capabilities: determination of the media and media parameters to be
   used;

 - Session setup: "ringing", establishment of session parameters at both
   called and calling party;

 - Session management: including transfer and termination of sessions,
   modifying session parameters, and invoking services. "


Traditionally, Presence was defined as 'the willingness and ability of a
user to communicate with other users on the network'. Presence today is much
broader and is redefined by Dean Willis as 'dynamically updated information
about the state of selected entities, where the information, states,
selection, and dynamically of update are variable and appropriate for the
application'. The software contains rich presence functionality not
available today in other SIP solutions.


End-user experiences
--------------------

The software allows you to create elegant real-time communications
applications without having to read the +1200 RFC documents behind it. If
you read them all, some antidepressant and desintoxication is recommended
after this effort.

As a library with a high-level API, the toolkit can also be used to add SIP
VoIP, IM and Presence functionality to various network devices (like TV
set-up boxes), as long as Python environment is supported by such platform.
You may collapse the whole telecom industry into a simple Call me button or
expand the presence buddy list to display the mood or blood pressure of your
buddies (if they want to share this information with you). Some of the
things possible with this library are listed here:

- VoIP calls using Internet codecs (wide-band Speex, iLBC) and G.711
- Zero configuration server-less communication over LAN (Bonjour)
- Presence using SIP SIMPLE (PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY and XCAP policy)
- Interactive Messaging (IM) and File Transfer using MSRP protocol


Testing the library
-------------------

Included with the distribution are a set of command-line tools that can be
used to:

- Setup IM or file-transfer sessions with or without support from a MSRP relay
- Setup up VoIP sessions with high-quality wideband codecs (speex)
- Handle PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY messages for SIP events like
  presence, xcap-diff, watcher-info, conference and message-summary
- Manage XCAP policy documents pres-rules, resource-lists, RLS-services and
  pidf-manipulation
- Setup up ad-hoc multi-party chat sessions with an MSRP chat server (under
  construction)

For testing, you can use your own infrastructure, an account from a SIP
service provider or by registering a free SIP account at http://sip2sip.info
