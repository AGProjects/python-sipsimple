Description
-----------

SIP SIMPLE client SDK is a Software Development Kit for easy development of
SIP end-points that support rich media like Audio, Instant Messaging, File
Transfers, Desktop Sharing and Presence.  Other media types can be easily
added by using an extensible high-level API.

The software has undergone in the past years several interoperability tests
at SIPIT (http://www.sipit.net) and today is of industry strength quality.


Background
----------

SIP stands for 'Sessions Initiation Protocol', an IETF standard described by
RFC 3261. SIP is an application-layer control protocol that can establish,
modify and terminate multimedia sessions such as Internet telephony calls
(VoIP). Media can be added to (and removed from) an existing session.

SIP allows the endpoints to negotiate and combine any type of session they
mutually understand like video, instant messaging (IM), file transfer,
desktop sharing and provides a generic event notification system with
real-time publications and subscriptions about state changes that can be
used for asynchronous services like presence, message waiting indicator and
busy line appearance.


Features
--------

The library has cross platform capabilities on Linux OS, Mac OSX and
Microsoft Windows.  The library should work with minimal changes on any
platform that supports C and Python development environments.

The SDK is suitable for building end-points like SIP clients or SIP
Application Servers.  To see what the SDK is capable of, you can try Blink

General

 * Written in Python programming language
 * Non-blocking asynchronous engine
 * High level middleware
 * Configuration framework
 * TLS Security for signaling (SIP) and media (MSRP, XCAP)
 * Multiple SIP Accounts support
 * Multiple Media Types per Session (e.g. Audio + IM)
 * Trace capability for all underlying protocols
 * Failover for DNS lookups, SIP and MSRP routing
 * Supports re-INVITE for adding and removing media
 * Automatically handling if IP Address changes
 * Audio conference bridge
 * Wav player and recorder
 * Acoustic Echo Cancelation
 * Answering machine
 * Wide-band Internet codecs: Speex and G722
 * PSTN compatible codecs: G711, iLBC, GSM

Supported media

 * Audio (RTP/sRTP)
 * Instant Messaging (MSRP)
 * File Transfer (MSRP)
 * Desktop Sharing (VNC over MSRP)

All media types can be combined together in the same SIP session.
