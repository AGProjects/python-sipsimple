Description
-----------

PyPjUA is an open-source software library combines PJSIP C SIP stack with an
elegant middleware that allows for easy development of feature-rich, easy
skinable SIP clients for desktop computers running MacOSX, Linux and Windows
operating systems, portable Internet devices like Nokia 810, Apple iPhone or
Android mobile phones.

The aim is to provide a future-proof SIP library implementation by choosing
the right programming language (Python), the right standards (SIP SIMPLE
suite of protocols developed within IETF) and a common sense feature-set
based on best industry practices and compatible with real-life SIP
deployments of open source service infrastructures based on OpenSER,
Asterisk, MediaProxy, OpenXCAP, MSRP Relay and their derivative solutions.
