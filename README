Description
-----------

SIP SIMPLE client is Python software library built on top of PJSIP that
together with middleware allows for easy development of Client/Server and
Peer-to-Peer Internet communications end-points based on SIP SIMPLE
protocols for voice, video, presence, instant messaging (IM) and file
transfer capabilities.

The goal of this project is to deliver the best Open Source Python library
for rich featured SIP end-points, while hiding the complex underlying
functionality behind an easy to use high-level application-programming
interface. This package supports to the SDP negotiation, audio codecs and
NAT traversal functionality provided by PJSIP and will thus deliver rich
communications combining instant messaging (IM), voice and video streams. It
also supports file transfer and multi-party chat sessions using MSRP
protocol, publication and subscription for rich presence information such as
availability, moods, activities and geo-location, management for presence
rules, resource lists, RLS services using XCAP protocol.

The software allows you to create elegant real-time communications
applications without having to read the +1200 RFC documents behind it.


Background
----------

SIP stands for 'Sessions Initiation Protocol', an IETF standard described by
RFC3261. SIP is an application-layer control protocol that can establish,
modify and terminate multimedia sessions such as Internet telephony calls
(VoIP). Media can be added to (and removed from) an existing session.

SIP transparently supports name mapping and redirection services, which
supports personal mobility, users can maintain a single externally visible
address identifier, which can be in the form of a standard email address or
an E.164 telephone number regardless of their physical network location.

SIP allows the endpoints to negotiate any type of session they mutually
understand (examples are ideo calls, instant messaging, file transfers,
desktop sharing) and provides a generic event notification system with
real-time publication and subscriptions about state changes that can be used
for asynchronous services (e.g. presence and message waiting indicators,
busy line appearance).


Features
--------

As a library with a high-level API, the toolkit can be used to add voice, IM
and Presence functionality to any network devices as long as Python/C
environment is supported by such platform.

Additional to the SIP standards implemented by the underlying PJSIP library,
this project implements:

 * XCAP protocol RFC4825
 * MSRP protocol RFC4975
 * MSRP protocol relay extension RFC4976
 * Rich presence data model and format RFC3856, RFC3863 , RFC4479
 * XCAP-diff document modification event draft-ietf-simple-xcap-diff-09
 * Watcher-info RFC3857, RFC3858
 * Conference RFC4575
 * Message summary RFC3842
 * Presence rules RFC5025
 * Resource-lists and RLS-services RFC4826
 * PIDF manipulation RFC4827
 * Bonjour multicast DNS draft-lee-sip-dns-sd-uri-02
 * Locating SIP services RFC3263
 * MSRP ad-hoc multi-party chat sessions draft-ietf-simple-chat-03

SIP SIMPLE client is closely developed together with and tested against the
most popular SIP SIMPLE server software available today: OpenSIPs from
http://opensips.org, OpenXCAP from http://openxcap.org and MSRPRelay from
http://msrprelay.org.

With the library, a set of command line tools are available for setting up
real time voice, IM and file transfer sessions, publish and subscribe to
presence or other type of events:

 * sip_register - REGISTER a SIP end-point with a SIP REGISTRAR
 * sip_audio_session - Setup a voice audio session (VoIP)
 * sip_im_session - Setup IM session and receive files using MSRP protocol
 * sip_send_file - Send a file using MSRP protocol
 * sip_message - Send text message in page mode using MESSAGE method
 * sip_publish_presence - PUBLISH presence to a SIP Presence Agent
 * sip_subscribe_presence - SUBSCRIBE to presence information
 * sip_subscribe_winfo - SUBSCRIBE to watcher list on a SIP Presence Agent
 * sip_subscribe_rls - SUBSCRIBE to lists managed by Resource List Server
 * xcapclient - Manage presence policy and buddy lists on an XCAP server
 * xcap_pres_rules - Manage content of pres-rules XCAP document
 * xcap_rls_services - Manage content of RLS services XCAP document

Some scripts can be used to setup audio (VoIP), interactive messaging (IM)
and file transfer sessions. Other scripts can be used to publish presence
information and subscribe to presence or other type of events. Running each
script with --help argument displays the script capabilities and the
required arguments.

For testing, you can use your own infrastructure or register a free SIP
SIMPLE account on http://SIP2SIP.info
