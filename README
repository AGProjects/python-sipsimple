Description
-----------

PyPjUA is Python software library for PJSIP C SIP stack that together with
an elegant middleware allows for easy development of real-time
communications end-points based on SIP protocol with rich presence and IM
capability that run on desktop computers running Mac OS X, Linux and Windows
operating systems, portable devices like Nokia Internet tablet, Apple iPhone
or Android mobile phone.

The goal of this project is to deliver the best Open Source development kit
for rich featured SIP User Agents while hiding the complex underlying
functionality behind an easy to use high-level application programming
interface. Compared to other available SIP libraries, this project adds both
to the client and to the corresponding open-source servers multiple media
streams support, 'the missing' SIP-SIMPLE features for rich presence
(presence rules, resource lists, rls services, rich PIDF, XCAP full and
partial document manipulation) and session based interactive messaging based
on MSRP protocol including relay support.

The software library is tested against the most popular SIP server software
available today: OpenSER, OpenXCAP, MSRPRelay and MediaProxy.


End-user experiences
--------------------

Using this software you are able to create elegant real-time communications
applications without having to read or understand the +1200 RFC documents
behind it. If you read them all some antidepressant and desintoxication is
recommended after this effort.

As a library with a high-level API, the toolkit can also be used to add SIP
and Presence functionality to network devices without a display (like TV
set-up boxes), as long as Python environment is supported by such platform.
You may collapse the whole telecom industry into a simple Call me button or
expand the presence buddy list to display the mood or blood pressure of your
buddies (if they want to share this information with you). Some of the
things possible with this library are listed here:

- VoIP calls using Internet codecs (wide-band Speex, iLBC) and G.711
- Zero configuration server-less communication over LAN (Bonjour)
- Presence using SIP SIMPLE (PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY and XCAP policy)
- Interactive Messaging (IM) and File transfer using MSRP protocol


Testing the library
-------------------

Besides the Python software library itself, the repository contains the
ready to use command-line examples scripts that can be used to:

- Setup IM or file-transfer sessions with or without support from a MSRP relay
- Setup up VoIP sessions with wide-band speex codec
- PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE and handle incoming NOTIFY for SIP events like
  presence, xcap-diff, watcher-info, conference, message-summary
- Manage XCAP documents pres-rules, resource-lists, rls-services and 
  pidf-manipulation
- Setup up ad-hoc multi-party chat sessions with an MSRP chat server (under
  construction)

Using these scripts is easy to test and prototype rich Presence, IM and VoIP
services based on the SIP protocol. To use these scripts you can use your
own SIP infrastructure or register a free SIP SIMPLE account on:
