Description
-----------

SIP SIMPLE client is Python software library built on top of PJSIP that
together with middleware allows for easy development of Internet
communications end-points based on SIP and related protocols for voice, rich
presence, instant messaging (IM) and file transfers. Other session types can
be easily added by using an extensible API.


Background
----------

SIP stands for 'Sessions Initiation Protocol', an IETF standard described by
RFC3261. SIP is an application-layer control protocol that can establish,
modify and terminate multimedia sessions such as Internet telephony calls
(VoIP). Media can be added to (and removed from) an existing session.

SIP transparently supports name mapping and redirection services, which
supports personal mobility, users can maintain a single externally visible
address identifier, which can be in the form of a standard email address or
E.164 telephone number regardless of their physical network location.

SIP allows the endpoints to negotiate and combine any type of session they
mutually understand like video, instant messaging (IM), file transfer,
desktop sharing and provides a generic event notification system with
real-time publications and subscriptions about state changes that can be
used for asynchronous services like presence, message waiting indicator and
busy line appearance.


Features
--------

The software allows you to create elegant real-time communications
applications without having to read the +1200 RFC documents behind it.

As a library with a high-level API, the toolkit can be used to add voice,
instant messaging (IM) and rich presence functionality to any device as long
as the Python/C environment is supported by such platform.

Additional to the SIP standards implemented by the underlying PJSIP library
and exposes through a Python API, this project implements session based
instant messaging (IM), file transfer and multi-party chat sessions using
MSRP protocol and its relay extension, publication and subscription for rich
presence information such as availability, moods, activities and
geo-location, management for presence rules, resource lists, RLS services
documents using XCAP protocol.
