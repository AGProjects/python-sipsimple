Command line clients
--------------------

Logging, based on trace_x configuration options:
 - Append PJSIP messages to .sipclient/log/user@domain/trace_pjsip.txt
 - Append SIP messages to .sipclient/log/user@domain/trac_sip.txt
 - Append MSRP messages to .sipclient/log/user@domain/trace_msrp.txt
 - Append XCAP messages to .sipclient/log/user@domain/trace_xcap.txt
 - Add timestamp and packet counters as for SIP trace for all other prorocols
 - Toggle logging at run time

- Add auto-accept option for sip_msrp_file_transfer client
- Add key command to start a call when starting in receiving mode (c)
- Add ? command key to display the available key commands
- Add functionality to msrp client script to send/receive files
- sip_msrp_chat_server (act as a conference server)
- sip_subscribe_conference_info

- print source of incomming NOTIFYs in sip_subscribe_x scripts
- sip_subscribe_presence to a list of URIs
- xcap_rls_services script, with service-uri as parameter default is user-buddies@samedomain
- xcap_pidf_manipulation script
- Publish service and status when starting/stopping rtp/msrp session script
- Set the shell return code to 0 (success) for 2XX, 3XX and 1 (failure) for
  other codes. For invite scripts the code is based on the response for the
  initial INVITE, not for the BYE If RTP was not received with 6 seconds after
  call setup, consider the call has failed.
- Add parameter to hangup after a number of seconds for sip_rtp and sip msrp
  scripts, used for scripting alarms
- Handle multiple incomming sessions (waiting for the re-INVITE)
- Conference established sessions
- Handle 301/302 redirect by prompting the user to accept/reject the redirection
- Combine msrp/rtp in one script
