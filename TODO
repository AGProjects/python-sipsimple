PJSIP bindings
--------------

Configure User Agent

sRTP
zRTP
Add option to record the audio session in a file
Comfort noice generator
Echo the DTMF tones using audio back to the user
Add feature to send OPTIONS method and parse the replys
Replace in configuration file the username and domain combination with one parameter called sip_address


Command line clients
--------------------

- To be able to use the scripts in alarm systens, set the shell return code
to 0 (success) for 2XX, 3XX and 1 (failure) for other codes. For invite
scripts the code is based on the response for the initial INVITE, not for
the BYE If RTP was not received with 6 seconds after call setup, consider
the call has failed.

- Add parameter for number of registrations to the sip_register script

- Add parameter to hangup after a number of seconds for sip_rtp and sip msrp
  scripts

- Add option to log the output of the scripts to a log file or syslog

- Add option to select an account from multiple accounts defined in the
  configuration file

- Display SDP endpoint addresses on successful INVITE

Nice to have
------------

Support IPv6
Survive local IP address changes


Lessons learned from other UAs
------------------------------

Basic configuration should have two items only: sip_address and password

The UA should be able to work on LAN without any configuration (Bonjour)

Never display words the end user cannot understand

Never display choices the user cannot understand

More than one click to find an useful option is acceptable only for a very
good reason

User can dial telephone numbers, partial (without the domain part) and
complete SIP addresses

The GUI must be focused on Instant Messaging (IM) with the display for rich
presence that contain icons and text.

The buddy list must contain the picture of each buddy, the picture is
published and updated by each buddy, is not managed by the watcher

The IM chat interface must display the the icon/picture of the buddy to
avoid typing messages to the wrong person.

Telephony interface must pop up only when dialing the PSTN (showing DTMF
keypad should for example automatically appear after first 183 is received)

The outgoing identity should be easy to select and the current identity
should be clearly displayed

IM interaction is more relevant than voice communications

Video is a must have useless feature

Desktop sharing focused one a single application is a useful business
environment feature (collaborative web browsing or shared power point screen)

Full desktop sharing is a usefull feature for home environment (help familly  
members solve their computer problem or plan holiday together)

The user must not be anoyed by notifications generated by the GUI

Ability to conferencing two persons withour a central server for both voice
and IM is a must

Logging of all network interactions must be available and saved locally 

Multi-party conferencing (invite people to a chat room) is a must to be able
to replace Jabber/XMPP

Gateway to/from XMMP world is nice to have, both SIP and XMPP are long lived
solutions unlikely to replace each other completely
