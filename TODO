Notifications
-------------

- review notifications after we have all entities implemented.
- check if we should separate the DidEnd notifications from the concept that
  the object posting it is no longer usable and make a new notification
  for that. There is a distinction between the fact that a certain entity
  has ended its cycle of operation and the concept that the entity becomes
  unusable. For some these overlap for others they don't and using a given
  notification with multiple meanings can be confusing.
