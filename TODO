Python PJSIP bindings
---------------------

- Add the MSRP transport class
- Document in the API specifications how other transports can be defined and
  implemented (use MSRP as example)
- Handle PJSIP and Pyrex/Cython compilation in setup.py
- Properly decrease reference counts of pjsip_tx_data structs
- Fix remainig TODOs for PUBLISH/REGISTER
- Cleanup Registration, Publication and Subscription to behave more like Invitation
- Registration requestion URI should be settable by application
- High level Invitation class that handles SDP as well
- Add feature to send OPTIONS method and parse the replies
- Add ability for application to request handling of arbitrary methods such as
  OPTIONS, REGISTER and REFER, SUBSCRIBE (but not INVITE or NOTIFY...) and have it reply.
- Handle sending and receiving of multipart bodies for Invitation
- Handle UPDATE for re-INVITE
- Means to query RTP statistics
- Add option to use the STUN response for Contact header (default false)
- Make local_ip option settable at runtime
- Remove any DNS or lookups from pjsip (lookup is always done outside PJSIP)
- Survive IP address changes
- IPv6 support


Audio
-----

- Fix high CPU usage for sound card access on OS X
- N810 maemo audio driver
- Mute the microphone for a given session (useful for listen in conferences)
- Play a tone while on hold every 30 seconds
- Play a tone once after we closed a session
- Play a tone when receiving a call while engaged in another call
- Add comfort noise generator
- Implement Automatic Gain Control
- Fix echo-cancelation for non speex codecs
- Conference established sessions
- zRTP


Instant Messaging
-----------------

- Document MSRP client library usage, wiki page
- Port eventlet/greenlet to ARM
- MSRP focus
- MSRP mixer
- MSRP multiparty chat
- Is-composing payload


Presence/XML
------------

- Conference-info event package
- xcap-diff payload
- Move non SIP applications to a separate python package
- Timed-status element http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4481
- Contact information http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4482
- Device capabilities http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5196
- PIDF location (geopriv)
  Shall we publish Google maps link in Person Note instead?
- Buddylist library


Other applications
------------------

- Message-summary payload
- Bonjour
- ENUM lookup


Middleware
----------

- Event bus
- Enrollment
- Ambient noise and light detection 
- Geo-location detection


Command line clients
--------------------

- Fix STUN blocking
- Port the audio features of sip_audio_session into sip_im_session
- Replace sip_im_session and sip_audio_session with one script 'sip_session'
- The default outbound invitation type is audio+text in this order (in SDP),
  add an option to start a 'text only' session
- An incoming session request must prompt the user to accept a) audio+text or b) text only
- Conference established sessions
- Add parameter to hangup after a number of seconds for sip_audio_session
- Logging, based on trace_x configuration options:
 - Append PJSIP messages to .sipclient/log/user@domain/pjsip_trace.txt
 - Append MSRP messages to .sipclient/log/user@domain/msrp_trace.txt
 - Append XCAP messages to .sipclient/log/user@domain/xcap_trace.txt
 - Add timestamp and packet counters as for SIP trace for all other prorocols
 - Toggle sip logging at run time

- Publish service and status changes from the sip_session script
- sip_subscribe_conference_info script
- xcap_pidf_manipulation script
- Set the shell return code to 0 (success) for 2XX, 3XX and 1 (failure) for
  other codes. For invite scripts the code is based on the response for the
  initial INVITE, not for the BYE If RTP was not received with 6 seconds after
  call setup, consider the call has failed.
- Handle 301/302 redirect by prompting the user to accept/reject the redirection
- Handle incoming REFER to a conference URI
