Python PJSIP bindings
---------------------

- Concatenate the user_agent with the software version number
- Add log of pjsip messages to a file, default is .sipclient/log/user@domain/pjsip.txt
- Handle re-INVITEs and UPDATE
- Return list of SIP headers of the response in the event handler
- Means to query RTP statistics
- Handle multipart bodies
- More advanced conference bridge control
- Fix high CPU usage
- TCP/TLS
- STUN/ICE
- Properly decrease reference counts of pjsip_tx_data structs
- Split up .pyx file
- Fix remainig TODOs for PUBLISH/REGISTER
- sRTP
- zRTP
- Add feature to send OPTIONS method and parse the replies
- Handle incomming REFER to msrp focus
- Remove any DNS or lookups from pjsip (lookup is always done outside PJSIP)
- API documentation


Command line clients
--------------------

- Append pjsip messages to .sipclient/log/user@domain/pjsip.txt
- Append SIP messages to .sipclient/log/user@domain/sip.txt
- Publish service and status when starting/stopping rtp/msrp session script
- Set the shell return code to 0 (success) for 2XX, 3XX and 1 (failure) for
  other codes. For invite scripts the code is based on the response for the
  initial INVITE, not for the BYE If RTP was not received with 6 seconds after
  call setup, consider the call has failed.
- Add parameter to hangup after a number of seconds for sip_rtp and sip msrp
  scripts, used for scripting alarms
- Add option to log the output of the scripts to a log file or syslog
- sip_subscribe_presence to a list of URIs
- Display current pres-rules on start of sip_subscribe_winfo script
- print source of incomming NOTIFYs
- xcap_rls_services script
- xcap_pres_rules script
- xcap_pidf_manipulation script
- add polite block to winfo pres-rules update
- Handle multiple incomming sessions (waiting for the re-INVITE)
- Conference established sessions
- Handle 301/302 redirect by prompting the user to accept/reject the redirection
- Combine msrp/rtp in one script
