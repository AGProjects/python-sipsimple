Python PJSIP bindings
---------------------

- Handle UPDATE for re-INVITE
- High level Invitation class that handles SDP as well
- Cleanup Registration, Publication and Subscription to behave more like Invitation
- Means to query RTP statistics
- Handle sending and received of multipart bodies for Invitation
- Fix high CPU usage
- Properly decrease reference counts of pjsip_tx_data structs
- Split up .pyx file
- Add option to use the STUN response for Contact header (default false)
- Fix remainig TODOs for PUBLISH/REGISTER
- Make all init_options passed to PJSIPUA attributes, set local_ip at runtime
- Add feature to send OPTIONS method and parse the replies
- Add ability for application to request handling of arbitrary methods such as
  OPTIONS, REGISTER and REFER, SUBSCRIBE (but not INVITE or NOTIFY...) and have it reply.
- Registration requestion URI should be settable by application
- Remove any DNS or lookups from pjsip (lookup is always done outside PJSIP)
- Write API documentation

Audio
-----

- Add option and command to mute the microphone (useful for listen in conferences)
- Play a soft beep tone while on hold every 30 seconds
- Play a beep after we closed a session
- Play a special beep when receiving a call while engaged in another call
- Implement Automatic Gain Control in PJSIP media engine
- zRTP

Command line clients
--------------------

Logging, based on trace_x configuration options:
 - Append PJSIP messages to .sipclient/log/user@domain/pjsip_trace.txt
 - Append MSRP messages to .sipclient/log/user@domain/msrp_trace.txt
 - Append XCAP messages to .sipclient/log/user@domain/xcap_trace.txt
 - Add timestamp and packet counters as for SIP trace for all other prorocols
 - Toggle sip logging at run time

- Add key command to start a session when starting in receiving mode (c)
- Create sip_subscribe_conference_info script
- xcap_pidf_manipulation script
- Publish service and status when starting/stopping rtp/msrp session script
- Set the shell return code to 0 (success) for 2XX, 3XX and 1 (failure) for
  other codes. For invite scripts the code is based on the response for the
  initial INVITE, not for the BYE If RTP was not received with 6 seconds after
  call setup, consider the call has failed.
- Add parameter to hangup after a number of seconds for sip_audio_session
- Handle multiple incomming sessions (waiting for the re-INVITE)
- Conference established sessions
- Handle 301/302 redirect by prompting the user to accept/reject the redirection
- Combine msrp/rtp in one script
 

Applications
