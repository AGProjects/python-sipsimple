Command line clients
--------------------

- To be able to use the scripts in alarm systens, set the shell return code
to 0 (success) for 2XX, 3XX and 1 (failure) for other codes. For invite
scripts the code is based on the response for the initial INVITE, not for
the BYE If RTP was not received with 6 seconds after call setup, consider
the call has failed.

- Add parameter for number of registrations to the sip_register script

- Add parameter to hangup after a number of seconds for sip_rtp and sip msrp
  scripts

- Add option to log the output of the scripts to a log file or syslog

- Add option to select an account from multiple accounts defined in the
