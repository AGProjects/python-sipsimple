Python PJSIP bindings
---------------------

- Handle re-INVITEs and UPDATE
- Return list of SIP headers of the response in the event handler
- Means to query RTP statistics
- Handle multipart bodies
- Fix high CPU usage
- TCP/TLS
- STUN/ICE
- Properly decrease reference counts of pjsip_tx_data structs
- Split up .pyx file
- Fix remainig TODOs for PUBLISH/REGISTER
- sRTP
- zRTP
- Add feature to send OPTIONS method and parse the replies
- Handle incomming REFER to msrp focus
- Remove any DNS or lookups from pjsip (lookup is always done outside PJSIP)
- Configurable RTP port range
- API documentation


Audio
-----

- Adjust echo cancelation tail length in real time
- More advanced conference bridge control
- Play a soft beep tone while on hold every 30 seconds
- Play a beep after we closed a session
- Play a special beep when receiving a call while engaged in another call
- Implement Automatic Gain Control AGC in PJSIP media engine


Command line clients
--------------------

Based on trace_x configuration options:
 - Append PJSIP messages to .sipclient/log/user@domain/trace_pjsip.txt
 - Append SIP messages to .sipclient/log/user@domain/trac_sip.txt
 - Append MSRP messages to .sipclient/log/user@domain/trace_msrp.txt
 - Append XCAP messages to .sipclient/log/user@domain/trace_xcap.txt
 - Add timestamp and packet counters as for SIP trace for all other prorocols
- print source of incomming NOTIFYs in sip_subscribe_x scripts
- sip_subscribe_presence to a list of URIs
- xcap_rls_services script, with service-uri as parameter default is user-buddies@samedomain
- xcap_pidf_manipulation script
- Publish service and status when starting/stopping rtp/msrp session script
- Set the shell return code to 0 (success) for 2XX, 3XX and 1 (failure) for
  other codes. For invite scripts the code is based on the response for the
  initial INVITE, not for the BYE If RTP was not received with 6 seconds after
  call setup, consider the call has failed.
- Add parameter to hangup after a number of seconds for sip_rtp and sip msrp
  scripts, used for scripting alarms
- Handle multiple incomming sessions (waiting for the re-INVITE)
- Conference established sessions
- Handle 301/302 redirect by prompting the user to accept/reject the redirection
- Combine msrp/rtp in one script
- sip_msrp_chat_server (act as a conference server)
- sip_msrp_chat_client (invite people to chat using REFER and resource-list)
- sip_subscribe_conference_info
